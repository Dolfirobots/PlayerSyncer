# Features

PlayerSyncer is packed with features designed to provide a seamless and flexible player synchronization experience.

## Core Features

### Real-time Synchronization

PlayerSyncer synchronizes player data in real-time. When a player switches servers, their data is instantly updated, providing a seamless experience.

### Selective Sync

You have full control over what data gets synchronized. Through the `config.yml` file, you can enable or disable the synchronization of:

-   Inventory and Armor
-   Ender Chest
-   Health and Food Levels
-   Experience and Levels
-   Potion Effects
-   Game Mode
-   And more!

### High Performance

PlayerSyncer is built with performance in mind. It uses an efficient database connection pool and optimized queries to ensure minimal impact on your server's performance.

### Broad Database Support

We support the most popular databases, so you can choose the one that best fits your needs:

-   MySQL
-   MariaDB
-   PostgreSQL

## Advanced Features

### Powerful Developer API

The PlayerSyncer API allows you to extend the plugin's functionality. You can:

-   Listen to sync events to trigger custom actions.
-   Add your own custom data to the synchronization process.
-   Build new features on top of PlayerSyncer.

For example, you could create a **cross-server chat** system that uses the PlayerSyncer API to send messages between servers.

### Data Migration and Management

PlayerSyncer provides commands to help you manage your player data, including forcing a sync for a specific player and checking the status of the plugin.

### Highly Configurable

Almost every aspect of PlayerSyncer is configurable. From database settings to sync options, you can fine-tune the plugin to your specific needs.
